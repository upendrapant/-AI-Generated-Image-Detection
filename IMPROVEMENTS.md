# Model Accuracy Improvements

This document outlines the key improvements made to achieve better accuracy in AI-generated image detection.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Increased Image Resolution**
- **Before**: 32x32 pixels
- **After**: 224x224 pixels
- **Impact**: Higher resolution allows the model to capture fine-grained details and artifacts that distinguish AI-generated images from real ones.

### 2. **Enhanced Model Architecture**
- **Embedding Dimension**: 256 → 768 (3x larger)
- **Number of Heads**: 8 → 12 (50% more attention heads)
- **Patch Size**: 4 → 16 (larger patches for better feature extraction)
- **Impact**: Larger model capacity allows learning more complex patterns and features.

### 3. **Extended Training**
- **Epochs**: 5 → 50 (10x more training)
- **Batch Size**: 16 → 32 (better gradient estimates)
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-4 → 3e-4 (faster convergence)
- **Impact**: More training time allows the model to converge to better solutions.

### 4. **Improved Data Augmentation**
Added sophisticated augmentation techniques specifically designed for AI detection:
- **Elastic Transform**: Simulates realistic distortions
- **Grid Distortion**: Adds geometric variations
- **Optical Distortion**: Mimics lens effects
- **CLAHE**: Enhances contrast locally
- **Random Shadow**: Adds realistic lighting variations
- **Increased blur limits**: Better robustness to image quality variations

### 5. **Advanced Training Techniques**
- **Gradient Clipping**: Prevents gradient explosion and improves stability
- **Improved Learning Rate Scheduling**: Better warmup and cosine annealing
- **Enhanced Mixup/CutMix**: Increased probability (70%) for better regularization
- **Better Early Stopping**: More patience (20 epochs) for longer training

### 6. **Optimized Data Splits**
- **Validation Split**: 20% → 15% (more training data)
- **Test Split**: 10% → 15% (better evaluation)
- **Impact**: More data for training while maintaining good evaluation.

## Expected Performance Gains

Based on these improvements, you should expect:

1. **Higher Accuracy**: 10-20% improvement in classification accuracy
2. **Better Generalization**: Enhanced robustness to different image types
3. **Improved Feature Detection**: Better at identifying AI-generated artifacts
4. **More Stable Training**: Reduced overfitting and better convergence

## How to Use the Improved Model

### 1. Run Improved Training
```bash
python run_improved_training.py
```

### 2. Monitor Training
```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/improved_vit
```

### 3. Use for Inference
```bash
python inference.py --model_path models/best_model_improved.pth --image_path your_image.jpg
```

## Training Time Considerations

- **GPU Training**: ~2-4 hours for 50 epochs
- **CPU Training**: ~8-12 hours for 50 epochs
- **Memory Usage**: ~4-6GB GPU memory (depending on batch size)

## Configuration Files

- `config.py`: Updated with improved hyperparameters
- `train_improved.py`: Enhanced training script with better techniques
- `run_improved_training.py`: Easy-to-use training launcher

## Monitoring and Debugging

The improved training includes:
- **TensorBoard Logging**: Real-time metrics and histograms
- **Enhanced Validation**: Better metrics tracking
- **Gradient Monitoring**: Automatic gradient clipping
- **Learning Rate Tracking**: Visualize LR scheduling

## Troubleshooting

### If training is slow:
- Reduce batch size in `config.py`
- Use fewer epochs initially
- Check GPU memory usage

### If accuracy is not improving:
- Check data quality and balance
- Increase training epochs
- Adjust learning rate
- Verify data augmentation is working

### If out of memory:
- Reduce batch size
- Reduce image size (but this will hurt accuracy)
- Use gradient accumulation

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **Ensemble Methods**: Train multiple models and combine predictions
2. **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained Vision Transformers
3. **Advanced Augmentation**: Add more domain-specific augmentations
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use automated hyperparameter optimization
5. **Data Quality**: Improve dataset quality and balance

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Original Model | Improved Model | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Image Size | 32x32 | 224x224 | 49x more pixels |
| Model Parameters | ~2M | ~22M | 11x larger |
| Training Epochs | 5 | 50 | 10x more training |
| Expected Accuracy | ~75-80% | ~85-90% | +10-15% |

The improved model should significantly outperform the original model in terms of accuracy and robustness.
